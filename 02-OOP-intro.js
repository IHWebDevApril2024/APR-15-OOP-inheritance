// OOP
// Object Oriented Programming 

// Basic object
const myWeekend = {
    todos: ["Homework", "Chill", "Play with my dog"],
    meetings: true
}

// This part is going to be different depending on the user. What we are doing is called hardcoding the info
const userName = "Mica";
const role = "UX/UI Teacher";
const experience = "A lot";

// we can add variables as values for an object
const user = {
    userName: userName,
    role: role,
    experience: experience
};

// Shortcut
const user2 = {
    userName,
    role,
    experience
}
